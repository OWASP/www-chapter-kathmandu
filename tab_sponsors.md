We are extremely grateful for the support of our sponsors for the OWASP Kathmandu Local Chapter meetup. We would like to thank Eminence Ways, a pioneer and finest cybersecurity firm in Nepal, for providing more than support to make this event successful. We are very grateful to Trilokya Technology, a software development company focused on developing security products, and Prominent Learners, an organization dedicated to providing cybersecurity training and certification to ensure best cybersecurity practices and hygiene. Without their help , we would not have been able to host the event. It is a pleasure to have their support and we thank them for supporting us.
